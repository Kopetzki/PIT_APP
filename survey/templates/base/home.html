                <p><b>Description of Application: </b> A web app to conduct PIT Surveys and Observations
                to streamline the process from paper to online.  This will make the PIT counts more accessible
                and portable to volunteers, and enable admin users to have automatic data analysis capabilities.</p>

            <p><b>About PIT Counts: </b><i>PIT counts are a critical source of data on the number and characteristics of people who are
            homeless in the United States. These data are used to measure homelessness on a local and
            national level and are published annually on HUD’s HUD Exchange website, which can be
            viewed by CoCs and the general public. PIT count data are also provided annually to Congress
            as part of the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR). The AHAR is used by Congress,
            HUD, other federal departments, and the general public to understand the nature and extent of
            homelessness. HUD’s PIT count data has become increasingly important as a measure of our
            local and national progress related to preventing and ending homelessness, especially with
            relation to our progress towards meeting the goals of Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan
            to Prevent and End Homelessness. Therefore, it has become necessary to ask for more
            detailed information and to ensure that the data submitted to HUD are as complete and
                accurate as practicable. [1]</i></p>
